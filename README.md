#  Hate Speech Detection on Twitter

As defined by the United Nations, hate speech refers to any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are (i.e. religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factors)

# Problem Statement
Automatic hate speech detection using machine learning has typically been done using classical methods. Over time, more complex deep learning methods have been introduced for more efficient and accurate detection. 

Given the advantages of deep learning methods, should the classical methods still be used? 

To answer this question, we will develop robust deep learning methods and compare them to optimised classical machine learning algorithms, thereby developing a comparative study.
